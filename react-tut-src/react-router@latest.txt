	•  { createBrowserRouter , RouterProvider,Route } from 'react-router-dom'

	//OBJECT BASED APPROCHED
	Router =  createBrowerRouter   
	=>  ( [ { path: '/' , element : <HomePage />  } ] ) 
	
	Return  <RouterProvider router= {Router} /> 

	• Alternative way to define routes - > From Elements JSX approach
	RouterDefinations =createRoutesFromElements( <Route> <Route path=' /home' element={compnent} />
	</Route>)
	Router =  createBrowerRouter  (RouterDefinations )
	
	
	• Pass them to RouterProvider with router prop
	<RouterProvider router ={Router} />
	

Links -> navigating between pages 

*imp Link from react-router-dom
*using anchor tag is not ideal for performance of react app - as it refreshes our SPA , it send request to server  
*Link component renders an anchor tag under the hood so all the css styling should be target to a:hover{} , not Link:hover{}

<Link to='/home' />
Prevents browser deault for sending a new http request <- optimal way


Error Page 

errorElement:  <- add this attribute below path attribute when it will catch error


NavLinks

*show which which link is active with class styles 
*not an regular className it takes anonymous function , destructres {isActive}
Its a boolean 

<NavLink to='/home' className={( { isActive}  )=>{isActive?"activeStyle" : "" } }

End - >  use to avoid other path being active as a route start with " / "  <-275 udemy


Navigating programatically

useNavigate hook => navigate ( '/home')


Dynamic Routes

/product/:proId <= colon ke baad everything is dynamic 

Params =useParams
Params.proId


///
createBrowserRouter , createRoutesFromElements, RouterProvider , Route

path, element , children :[], errorElement: , 

NavLink - to , className(isActive) , end
Link - to=".." (relative path hota hai ..) , className , relative-(default is route / set to "path" )
Outlet - render children components in parent 
absolute vs relative path = / , " " 


useNavigate - programatic navigation 
useParams



//DATA FETCHING 
loader: async() =>{}  - use to fetch data and provide them all copoments near level/ down level only
